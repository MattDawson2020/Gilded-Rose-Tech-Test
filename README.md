# Gilded rose tech test

## My Plan

- My first step was to read the challenge specifications carefully and examine the legacy code left for me to understand exactly what the steps to completion were
- I quickly realized that trying to fix the original method was going to be substantially harder than simply rewriting it bit by bit, which would also allow me to TDD
- I wrote a template if statement to be placed inside the iterator method to determine logic based on item name, each branch would have its own helper methods
- I first wrote the logic for the aged brie because it was unique in not degrading, and wrote minimal code to pass this
- I then added sell_in logic and maximum quality logic, then refactoring maximum quality to be usable by any other branch
- I followed this strategy item by item, writing tests for the full item requirements, passing it with bulky code, then extracting this code to helper methods for better SRP
- This eventually lead to all basic logic passing, from here it was just a matter of refactoring the code to make sure operations were as efficient and DRY as possible
- By the end the only other task was to comb through my tests and make sure there was proper coverage, and use RSpec syntax to reduce the repetition as much as possible
- The end result is my code is both much easier to read than the old code, but the SRP helper methods and tests make it extremely easy to change
- For final thoughts I think my main iteration method is larger than I would like, but cannot think of a simple/ cleaner way to do it than what I have now





## Kata details

This is a well known kata developed by Terry Hughes. This is commonly used as a tech test to assess a candidate's ability to read, refactor and extend legacy code.

Here is the text of the kata:

\*"Hi and welcome to team Gilded Rose. As you know, we are a small inn with a prime location in a prominent city run by a friendly innkeeper named Allison. We also buy and sell only the finest goods. Unfortunately, our goods are constantly degrading in quality as they approach their sell by date. We have a system in place that updates our inventory for us. It was developed by a no-nonsense type named Leeroy, who has moved on to new adventures. Your task is to add the new feature to our system so that we can begin selling a new category of items. First an introduction to our system:

All items have a SellIn value which denotes the number of days we have to sell the item. All items have a Quality value which denotes how valuable the item is. At the end of each day our system lowers both values for every item. Pretty simple, right? Well this is where it gets interesting:

Once the sell by date has passed, Quality degrades twice as fast
The Quality of an item is never negative
“Aged Brie” actually increases in Quality the older it gets
The Quality of an item is never more than 50
“Sulfuras”, being a legendary item, never has to be sold or decreases in Quality
“Backstage passes”, like aged brie, increases in Quality as it’s SellIn value approaches; Quality increases by 2 when there are 10 days or less and by 3 when there are 5 days or less but Quality drops to 0 after the concert
We have recently signed a supplier of conjured items. This requires an update to our system:

“Conjured” items degrade in Quality twice as fast as normal items
Feel free to make any changes to the UpdateQuality method and add any new code as long as everything still works correctly. However, do not alter the Item class or Items property as those belong to the goblin in the corner who will insta-rage and one-shot you as he doesn’t believe in shared code ownership (you can make the UpdateQuality method and Items property static if you like, we’ll cover for you)."\*

# Gilded Rose Refactoring Kata

This Kata was originally created by Terry Hughes (http://twitter.com/TerryHughes). It is already on GitHub [here](https://github.com/NotMyself/GildedRose). See also [Bobby Johnson's description of the kata](http://iamnotmyself.com/2011/02/13/refactor-this-the-gilded-rose-kata/).

I translated the original C# into a few other languages, (with a little help from my friends!), and slightly changed the starting position. This means I've actually done a small amount of refactoring already compared with the original form of the kata, and made it easier to get going with writing tests by giving you one failing unit test to start with. I also added test fixtures for Text-Based approval testing with TextTest (see [the TextTests](https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata/tree/master/texttests))

As Bobby Johnson points out in his article ["Why Most Solutions to Gilded Rose Miss The Bigger Picture"](http://iamnotmyself.com/2012/12/07/why-most-solutions-to-gilded-rose-miss-the-bigger-picture), it'll actually give you
better practice at handling a legacy code situation if you do this Kata in the original C#. However, I think this kata
is also really useful for practicing writing good tests using different frameworks and approaches, and the small changes I've made help with that. I think it's also interesting to compare what the refactored code and tests look like in different programming languages.

I use this kata as part of my work as a technical coach. I wrote a lot about the coaching method I use in this book [Technical Agile Coaching with the Samman method](https://leanpub.com/techagilecoach). A while back I wrote this article ["Writing Good Tests for the Gilded Rose Kata"](http://coding-is-like-cooking.info/2013/03/writing-good-tests-for-the-gilded-rose-kata/) about how you could use this kata in a [coding dojo](https://leanpub.com/codingdojohandbook).

## How to use this Kata

The simplest way is to just clone the code and start hacking away improving the design. You'll want to look at the ["Gilded Rose Requirements"](https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata/tree/master/GildedRoseRequirements.txt) which explains what the code is for. I strongly advise you that you'll also need some tests if you want to make sure you don't break the code while you refactor.

You could write some unit tests yourself, using the requirements to identify suitable test cases. I've provided a failing unit test in a popular test framework as a starting point for most languages.

Alternatively, use the "Text-Based" tests provided in this repository. (Read more about that in the next section)

Whichever testing approach you choose, the idea of the exercise is to do some deliberate practice, and improve your skills at designing test cases and refactoring. The idea is not to re-write the code from scratch, but rather to practice designing tests, taking small steps, running the tests often, and incrementally improving the design.

## Text-Based Approval Testing

This code comes with comprehensive tests that use this approach. For information about how to run them, see the [texttests README](https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata/tree/master/texttests)

## Translating this code

More translations are most welcome! I'm very open for pull requests that translate the starting position into additional languages.

Please note a translation should ideally include:

- a translation of the production code for 'update_quality' and Item
- one failing unit test complaining that "fixme" != "foo"
- a TextTest fixture, ie a command-line program that runs update_quality on the sample data for the number of days specified.

Please don't write too much code in the starting position or add too many unit tests. The idea with the one failing unit test is to tempt people to work out how to fix it, discover it wasn't that hard, and now they understand what this test is doing they realize they can improve it.

If your programming language doesn't have an easy way to add a command-line interface, then the TextTest fixture is probably not necessary.

## Better Code Hub

I analysed this repo according to the clean code standards on [Better Code Hub](https://bettercodehub.com) just to get an independent opinion of how bad the code is. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the compliance score is low!
